One-On-One Soccer - By Rosh Mendis
==================================

A very fun to play one-on-one soccer game. You can either play against a computer opponent or a friend (which is much more fun !)

Game Library
------------
The game comes with a game library I made myself. It contains a set of functions that should make game programming for you a lot easier - especially when implementing collision detection and artifical intelligence in your own games. Feel free to use it for your games.

Controls
--------
The blue player uses the arrow keys
The red player uses 	w for up
			s for down
			a for left
			d for right
Which is kind of like the arrow keys

Opponents
---------
To program the artifical intelligence for the computer opponents I used my game library. The opponents move depending on the direction it is to the ball. Basically, it just follows the ball until it gets in a scoring position where it then attempts to score. The cleverest opponent is Dexter and he is quite difficult to beat. To create the other opponents I just used Dexter's intelligence as the basis and commented other certain movements. This is why you will find that the other opponents act quite retardedly. I think I should have put a bit more work into the other opponents. 

Known Bugs
----------
Sometimes when you play one-on-one soccer, the players move much faster than they should be moving, making the game difficult and in some cases impossible to play. This is because of the way Visual Basic handles its timer controls and I have experienced this problems in some of my other games as well. I think it is because too much RAM has been used up or the computer is not fast enough to handle the timers. The only way to get the game to work properly again is to restart the computer. If you have a solution to this problem or know more about why this occurs please contact me through email.
