### Description

Hi Ppl,

Well!! I was feeling bored and lonely so thought should code a game, well this code I started in the soccer world cup fever and now it has finished. Well, about the game; a simple soccer game which shows you how to use different objects and how to move them around the form by using some maths functions, great master piece of mine till now. I want to request you guys about one thing, if you are downloading this code, please try to rate it coz thats how we get the recognition on this site,just few second of urs can give an identity to a programmer in this big world of programming. Thank you

Enjoy

<BM>
